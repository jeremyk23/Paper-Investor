iOS app to invest paper money in real stocks

This was my first iPhone app I ever made and I decided to put it up on Github for nostalgic reasons. 

Some of the original art assests are missing and I changed the file structure a little to get it up on Github so it probably will not compile. However, it is still fun to look back on my first foray into iOS programming.
