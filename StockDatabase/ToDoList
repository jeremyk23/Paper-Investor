-NOTES
Core data sets up relational database. THIS RD has a TABLE. Table represents a type; say a person. Each column represents something like their name, age, SSID, ect. Each row is a new person. 
-Model file is the whole CoreData file that stores all info and properties and relationships and what not.

Each table in Objective C (called an ENTITY), is like an object: columns or instance variables, (these are the Entity's ATTRIBUTES).

-Each StockItem has a to-one relationship with the PortfolioType. (It can only belong to one PortfolioType.) 
    -Each PortfolioType has a to-many relationship because it can refer to multiple stock items. 
    -This way we can ask StockItem "What SINGLE thing is your type" and vice versa, ask PorftolioTypes, "What MANY stocks do you hold?"
    
-When an object is fetched with core data, its class is by default NSManagedObject, (a subset of NSObject).
    -by changing StockItem's class to StockItem in the model file, I made it so when it is fetched, it will be a StockItem, NOT An NSManagedObject. The PortfolioType is still an NSManaged object.
